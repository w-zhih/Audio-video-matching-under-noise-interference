# Audio-video matching under noise interference

## Introduction

Given several pairs of silent video and audio files, this project will use machine learning methods to extract their visual and auditory features, and design a similarity measure between audio and visual information to evaluate the match between the silent video and audio data, so as to retrieve the original audio file corresponding to each silent video. In addition to this, the audio and video signals captured in real environments often have noise pollution, and how to achieve accurate audio and video matching under the conditions of noise interference is also the content of this project research.

## Dataset

In this project, 3339 sets of training data were provided for training the model, and 804 segments of disrupted video data and audio data were provided for testing. and audio data for testing. Each training data set contains paired video and audio files and pre-extracted features.
